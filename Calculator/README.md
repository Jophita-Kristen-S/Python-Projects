This project is a simple GUI-based calculator built with PyQt5. It supports essential arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and exponentiation. The calculator features an intuitive interface with buttons for digits (0–9), operators, decimal point (.), clear (C), delete (D), and equals (=). User inputs are displayed in real time, and expressions are evaluated instantly when the equals button is pressed. This project demonstrates the use of PyQt5 widgets, grid layouts, and event handling to build an interactive desktop application in Python.
