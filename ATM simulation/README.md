This is a console-based banking management system implemented in Python. It is an simulation of some basic banking operations like account opening, deletion, login-based account management, deposits, withdrawals, checking account balances, and tracking transaction history.

The system uses modular, object-oriented programming, in which every main banking system module is coded in its own Python file. USER and TRANSACTION data is stored in a JSON file database. Hence, when the program finishes, data is not lost.

The user is able to make secure accounts using an email address and password, make authentic banking transactions, as well as display all transactions. Every transaction performed updates the previous balance, amount, as if actual banking were taking place.
